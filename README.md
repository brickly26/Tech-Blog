# Tech Blog

## Description

In this assignment assignment I created Tech Blog were users can post question and recieve feedback from other user through comments. I started by creating a database with 3 tables, Users, Posts, and Comments. This allowed me to create relationships between them like Users have many Posts and Posts have many comments etc. I then created Api routes that granted me access to get, add, update and delete data from the database using front-end api calls. Afterwards I used HandleBars to create template html that I would use on different pages on the website. Final I was able to create front end Javascript to that allows user to login/register, add/delete post, etc.
